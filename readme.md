# Ligand Interaction Network

## Introduction

This was put together quite quickly at the CECAM 2015 Analysing Simulation Data Workshop. It is not to be trusted in its present state.

## What does this do?

Reads a simulation topology and trajectory, computes distances between all atoms of a selected protein and a selected ligand and provides some basic analysis and visualisation of distances.

## How can I use it?

Have a look at the `tests/test.sh` and `tests/test.py` for some examples of calling via the command line and as a python module.
